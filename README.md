Obsidian-Studios, Inc. funtoo/gentoo overlay (a.k.a wltjr's overlay)

Things that could and should be in Gentoo but are not.

Go GENTOO! :-1:

## About
This overlay mostly contains Java related ebuilds. Most of the 
ebuilds are not in tree, but some are corrections, newer versions 
and/or slot chantes. Initial support for Java 9, JDK only at this time. 

Effort will be made to keep packages in this overlay up to date. All 
ebuilds in this overlay should be production quality and many are used 
in production, though some are not. Contributions are welcome!
