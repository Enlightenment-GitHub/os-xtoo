# xtoo-overlay
Obsidian-Studios, Inc. funtoo/gentoo overlay (a.k.a wltjr's overlay)

Things that could and should be in Gentoo but are not. Trying to get 
things updated in Gentoo has proven to be futile and a waste of time. 
Most everything in this overlay would be in Gentoo but is not. Due to 
lack of a team enviroment and inability to contribute directly in an 
efficient manner. Thus they will go into this overlay instead.

Go GENTOO! :(

This overlay mostly contains Java related ebuilds. Java on Gentoo is one 
of the most neglected areas of Gentoo. Even more so since around 2008 
till current. There has been active development and lots of improvement 
in 2015. The Java enviromentment on Gentoo is still far from usable 
for most Java developers. Many packages are not actively maintained and 
kept current. Tons of Java applications are not packaged. Applications 
that will get packaged and put into this overlay. Effort will be made to 
keep this overlay up to date as things once were in Gentoo.

Most ebuilds in this overlay are Copyright Obsidian-Studios, Inc. They 
can be used else where, but the copyright must be respected and preserved.
